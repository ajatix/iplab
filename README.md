The codes written for Image processing lab.
The objective of the lab was to write manual functions, without using the standard libraries of OpenCV to gain a deeper understanding of the image processing algorithms.

List of experiments:

1. Reading and writing a Bitmap image
2. Spatial filtering of images - Laplacian, Sobel, Mean, Median
3. Wavelet decomposition of bitmaps
4. Morphological operations
5. Image rotation and scaling by interpolation
6. FFT domain transforms - Butterworth, Gaussian high/low pass
7. Histogram equalization of images
8. Otsu thresholding and connected component labelling
9. Image segmentation by region growing

Update: Working on parallelization of the codes using NVIDIA CUDA.
